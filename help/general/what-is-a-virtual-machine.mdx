A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). 

Software called a hypervisor separates the machine's resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.
