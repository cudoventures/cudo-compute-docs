You can delete your account by using the "Delete user" feature available on the [Personal info](https://compute.cudo.org/profile/personal-info) page. Make sure you have backed up any critical information from your account as the deletion is permanent.

1. Click on the red text (I have backed up critical data and wish to delete my user) to bring up the deletion form.
Optional: specify the reason for your account closure in the feedback field and submit it.
2. Confirm your email address in the respective field.
3. Click Delete user to delete your account.

You cannot delete an account that still has rented resources. You will have to delete the resources first.

You cannot delete an account with pending invoices. You will have to clear the invoices before deleting your account. In such situations, please contact the support team via the chat bubble if you need support identifying the outstanding invoices. State the reason for your inquiry in the first message to expedite the process.
