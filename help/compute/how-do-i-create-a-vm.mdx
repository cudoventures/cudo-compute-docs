There are two ways of creating a virtual machine using the web interface:

- __Choosing an app__: 
The app marketplace hosts a variety of compute templates and start-up scripts, tailored to specific workloads.
<Note>
The operating system, SSH access, start-up script and virtual machine name can still be configured by the user before deploying a virtual machine from the app marketplace.
</Note>

- __Creating a virtual machine from scratch__: The advantage in this case is that you can define all of the properties the virtual machine will be deployed with, including machine specs, operating system, SSH access, start-up script, and virtual machine name.

For more context please see the [Create a virtual machine documentation](/guides/virtual-machines/create-a-virtual-machine).
