### Adding a security group rule

To add a security group rule navigate to the security group you wish to add a rule too and click the **"Add rule" button**. Next, you will need to enter the details of the rule you wish to add.

- **Direction** - this is the direction of the traffic you wish to allow (inbound or outbound)
- **Protocol** - this is the protocol of the traffic you wish to allow (All, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6, IPsec)
- **IP range** - this is the IP range of the traffic you wish to allow
- **Ports** - this is the port range of the traffic you wish to allow (only valid for TCP or UDP protocols)
- **ICMP type** - this is the ICMP type of the traffic you wish to allow (only valid for ICMP or ICMPv6 protocols)

Once you are happy, click **"Save"** and your rule will be added to your security group.

## Managing security group rules

Clicking the security group name from the security group list will show you the security group rules page. You will be able to see the security group ID and a list of the rules that you have added to your security group.
