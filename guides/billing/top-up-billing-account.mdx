To top-up and add credit balance to your billing account you'll first need to navigate to the billing account you wish to add balance too.

On the overview page you will will see a **"Add to credit balance"** button in the first section. Click this to open the credit balance slideover.

- **Amount to credit** - The amount you wish to top-up your billing account with
- **Payment method** - The payment method on your billing account that you wish to charge this too

Click **Continue** and the amount will be credited to your billing account. To find out more about how billing works, [see billing account documentation](/docs/billing)

<Note>
We also recommend [configuring auto-recharge](/guides/billing/configure-auto-recharge) to prevent your resources from being deleted when your credit balance is insufficient.
