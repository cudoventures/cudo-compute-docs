Auto recharge is a feature which will automatically charge your default payment method when your credit balance drops below a specified threshold. This allows you to use resources on the platform without worrying about repeatedly manually topping up your credit balance, and also helps avoid automatic resource deletion which occurs as a result of your balance dropping to $0.00.

To configure auto recharge on your billing account you'll first need to navigate to the billing account you wish to active this on.

If auto recharge is disabled, you will see an alert titled **Auto recharge is off**. Click the **Enable auto recharge** link inside this alert to open the **Configure auto recharge** dialog.

You will also see this alert when you go to create a resource if you do not have auto recharge enabled. To configure auto recharge from here, just click the link provided inside the alert. You will not lose any progress in your form.

- **Toggle** - Enable auto-recharge
- **When my credit balance falls to** - When your credit balance falls to this amount or below, your account will recharge itself using the billing account's default payment method.
- **Bring my credit balance back up to** - The amount wish to bring your credit balance back up too when it hit's the threshold provided above.

Click **Continue**. You have now enabled auto-recharge.
