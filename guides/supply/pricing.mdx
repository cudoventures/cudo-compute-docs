description: Recommended pricing when you offer hardware on our network as a supplier.
---

When you come onboard as a CUDO Compute supplier, we allow you to set your own pricing for each asset within your hardware that can currently be monetised. Currently, we support the ability to price as follows:

- Cost per vCPU hour
- Cost per GiB memory hour
- Cost per GiB local disk hour
- Cost per GPU hour
- Cost per IPv4 address hour



Here are some examples of pricing already live on our network. Please note that you are welcome to choose any pricing you wish, but the below is a good example of what we have seen successful on our platform to date.

|                        | Lowest | Highest |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| Per vCPU (hour)        | $0.0021 | $0.0050 |
| Per GiB Memory (hour)  | $0.0013 | $0.0050 |
| Per GiB Storage (hour) | $0.0001 | $0.0025 |

We have many different types, models and generations of CPUs available, example pricing shown is to illustrate this range.

For GPUs however, we have provided the average cost of a subset of examples on our platform.

|                  | Hourly price average |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| NVIDIA RTX 3080  | $0.07   |
| NVIDIA RTX A4000 | $0.29   |
| NVIDIA RTX A5000 | $0.52   |
| NVIDIA RTX A6000 | $0.78   |
