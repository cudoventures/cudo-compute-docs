Storage disks are virtual disks that operate just like physical disks. You can attach & detach created storage disks to and from virtual machines in the same data center.

## What are disks used for?

Storage disks allow a VM to read and write from data that has a longer lifetime than the VM itself. In addition, being able to attach and detach disks allows data to be handed off between multiple VMs in the same data center.

::Alert{variant="warning"}
When your credit balance reaches $0.00, your resources will be deleted. This includes disks, so loss of data on disks is a risk if are are unable to charge you for your usage. We recommend configuring auto recharge to prevent this from happening.
