A volume is a Network File System (NFS) that can be accessed from cluster machines. Volumes are useful for storing data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a cluster machine, such as databases, training data, models, logs, or user data.

## Features

- Volumes are designed to be accessed from cluster machines as a Network File System (NFS).
- Volumes can store large amounts of data.
- Volumes can be attached to cluster machines at any time, even after the cluster machine has been created.
