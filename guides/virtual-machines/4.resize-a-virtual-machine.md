In order to resize a virtual machine, it must be [stopped](/docs/virtual-machines/resize-a-virtual-machine) first. Once the virtual machine is no longer running, you can click the "Resize" button on the virtual machines list page.

This will open a dialog box that allows you to select the new values for both vCPUs and Memory (RAM). Once you are happy with your new values, click "Resize virtual machine" and the VM will be resized in a matter of seconds. You can then start your virtual machine once again.
