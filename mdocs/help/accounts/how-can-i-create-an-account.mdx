There are two ways you can create an account:

- Log in with an existing GitHub, Google or Microsoft account. This will connect the Compute platform to your existing account.
- Create a new account by filling out the form on this page. Make sure to check your Spam inbox as well if you did not receive an email verification email in your inbox.

Congratulations! Welcome to the CUDO Compute console.
