When viewing resources on the CUDO Compute platform, you will see both hourly and monthly costs displayed. The difference between these two pricing displays is as follows:

1. Hourly costs are calculated as the cost of the resource for a 60 minute period.
2. Monthly costs are calculated as the cost of the resource for a 730 hour period.
