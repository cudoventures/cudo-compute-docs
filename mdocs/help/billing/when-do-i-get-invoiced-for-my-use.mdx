All users registering on the platform are enrolled in a subscription based billing system. This means that bills are issued on a one-month interval after you create your billing account.
E.g. If you create the account on 17/01/2023, your bill will be issued on 17/02/2023.

Depending on the costs accrued in a given time frame, users will be invoiced earlier. Your current invoicing threshold can be seen on your billing account page.

The billing thresholds are:
$10, $50, $100, $500 and $1000
The bill is sent to the email address specified in your account.
This can be paid in a few ways, so please observe and follow the on-screen instructions.
