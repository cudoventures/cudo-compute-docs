When creating a Windows VM, as a security measure, you will have to specify a password that can grant you access to the cloud instance once this is created and running.

This password can be used for remote access using e.g. the Windows built-in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Connection.

The details you will need for this type of remote connection are:
- Username - usually administrator or admin;
- Password - the password set when configuring the VM;
- IP address - visible on the VM page as Public IP.
