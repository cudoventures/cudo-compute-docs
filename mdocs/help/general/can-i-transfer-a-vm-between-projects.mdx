A VM cannot be transferred between projects.

We suggest this alternative option:

* If you intend to change only the project and not the data centre, set up the VM according to your requirements, and save a private image of this.
* In the new project folder, create a new VM with the identical specifications to the VM you created the private image from, then choose the private image as the OS for the new VM.

<Note>
The private image will not be available when creating a VM with a different data centre than the VM used to create the private image.
