Yes, __charges for billable resources continue to accrue__ even if these are powered off.

The reason for this is because the underlying hardware and other resources that enable your virtual machine are reserved for your virtual machine to ensure availability when you wish to power it back on.

If you wish to stop accruing costs __you will need to delete any chargeable resources__ in your project(s).
