The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.

SSH is typically used to access Linux virtual machines (VMs) remotely. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.
