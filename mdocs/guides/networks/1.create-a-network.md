Navigate to the project you wish to create a network within and head to the "Networks" page. Once there press **"Create a network"**. A slideover will appear with the form fields below.

- **Network ID** - _this is the name of your network, it must be unique_
- **Data center** - _this is the data center that your network will be deployed to_
- **Address range** - _this is the range of IP addresses that will be available to your virtual machines_

Once you are happy, click **Create network** and your network will be deployed to the data center you selected.

## Address ranges

The IP address range must be valid for private networking usage. As per [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918), the following ranges are valid:

- 10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0/12 IP addresses: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0/16 IP addresses: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

## Deploy a virtual machine to your network
