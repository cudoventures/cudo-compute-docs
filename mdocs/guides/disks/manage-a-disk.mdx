## Attach a disk

Any disk in the Ready state can be attached to a virtual machine in the same data center. Open the action menu (â‹®) for the disk and choose **Attach disk to virtual machine**, pick the virtual machine and confirm.

You will now see the disk listed on the virtual machine details page.

## Detach a disk

Open the action menu and choose **Detach disk from virtual machine**. Confirm to detach. The disk can then be attached to another virtual machine.

## Delete a disk

<Note>
You can only delete disks that are not attached to a virtual machine.
</Note>

Open the action menu and choose **Delete disk**. Enter the disk name to confirm deletion. Billing stops immediately after deletion.
