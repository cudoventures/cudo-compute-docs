Storage disks are virtual, detachable block devices. You can attach & detach created storage disks to and from virtual machines in the same data center.

## Why use disks?

Disks let a VM read and write data that persists beyond the VM lifetime. You can also hand data off between multiple VMs in the same data center by detaching and re-attaching.

<Note variant="warning">
When your credit balance reaches $0.00, your resources (including disks) are deleted. Configure auto recharge to prevent loss of data.
