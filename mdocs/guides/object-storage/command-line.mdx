When working with S3-compatible object storage two popular CLI tools are s3cmd and s5cmd.

- s3cmd - mature, feature rich
- s5cmd - high performance & parallel operations

## s3cmd installation

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install s3cmd
```

## Configure s3cmd

You will need an object storage user and a bucket. Gather:

- Access & secret key: Project > Object storage > Users > select user
- Endpoint: Project > Object storage > Buckets > select bucket (remove https:// prefix)

Run interactive setup:

```bash
s3cmd --configure
```

Follow prompts (use provided endpoint, test, then save). Your config is stored at `~/.s3cfg`.

List buckets:

```bash
s3cmd ls
```

Upload a file:

```bash
s3cmd put local-file.txt s3://your-bucket-name/
```

Delete a file:

```bash
s3cmd del s3://your-bucket-name/file.txt
```
