S3-compatible object storage is a type of cloud storage that allows you to store and retrieve data. It uses a simple web
services interface that is designed to work with Amazon S3's API, making it easy to integrate with existing applications
and tools that support S3. With S3-compatible object storage, you can securely store and access your data from anywhere,
ensuring high availability and durability. This type of storage is ideal for applications that require scalable storage solutions,
such as backups, archives, and big data analytics.
