## Create a user

Navigate to the project you wish to create an object storage user within and find the "Object storage" section in the left-hand navigation menu. Open the "Users" page.
Once there press **"Create a user"**. A slideover will appear with the form fields below:

- **Data center** - _this is the data center that your user will be created in_
- **Name** - _this is the name of the user you will create_

Once you are happy, click **"Create user"** and your user will be created in the data center you selected.

## View users keys
Click on the user ID and you will see your S3 API keys for that user. You can generate new keys using the **"Generate a key"** button

## Edit user settings
On the user page clicking the **"Settings"** tab gives you the ability to change a users access rights or to delete the user.
