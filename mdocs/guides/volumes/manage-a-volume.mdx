## View volumes

Open **Volumes** to list all volumes in the project. Each entry exposes an action menu (⋮).

## Resize a volume

Choose **⋮ > Resize volume**, enter the new (larger) size and confirm. Resizing is irreversible in the downward direction.

## Delete a volume

Choose **⋮ > Delete volume**, enter the volume name and confirm. This permanently removes the volume and stops billing.
