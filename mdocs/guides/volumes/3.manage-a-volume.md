## Managing volumes

Clicking **Volumes** in the project navigation menu will take you to the volumes list page. This page shows you all of the volumes in your project, and allows you to manage them.

You can use the options menu on the right-hand side of each volume to perform actions on that volume. The options menu contains the following items:

- [View connection options](docs/volumes/attach-a-volume-to-a-cluster-machine)
- [Resize volume](#resize-a-volume)
- [Delete volume](#delete-a-volume)

## Resize a volume

In the CUDO Compute console, go to the **Volumes** page and click **⋮ > Resize volume** . In the **Resize volume** dialog, enter the new size of the volume and click **Resize volume**.

## Delete a volume

Deleting a volume is permanent and cannot be undone, so make sure you have backed up any data you need before deleting a volume.

In the CUDO Compute console, go to the **Volumes** page and click **⋮ > Delete volume**. In the **Delete volume** dialog, enter the name of the volume to confirm deletion and click **Delete volume**.
