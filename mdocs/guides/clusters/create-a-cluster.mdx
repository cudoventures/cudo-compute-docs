Navigate to the project you wish to create a cluster in. Then, navigate to "Clusters" from the side navigation and click **Create cluster** or [follow this link](https://compute.cudo.org/?create=cluster).

## Configuration

### Name
Enter a name for your cluster. This will be used to identify your cluster in the clusters list.

<Note>
Your cluster name must be 1 to 30 characters in length, can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, must start with a letter, cannot end with a hyphen and cannot be in use.
</Note>

### Data center
By default, your cluster will be deployed to the cheapest data center available depending on your configuration. If you have a specific data center you would like to deploy to, you can select it from the Data center options.

### Machine type
Configure the machine type you would like to deploy. The specifications of the machines will be shown as a list; selecting one shows you the specifications in the summary on the right-hand side.

We recommend selecting a machine type that suits your workload (for example one with Infiniband if you need high-speed networking between cluster machines). If you are unsure, please contact us.

### SSH keys
Configure the SSH keys you would like to be deployed to your cluster machines. Options:

- Include all project collaborator keys
- Include only my keys
- Use custom keys (add any specific keys for these machines)

### Start script
Provide a start script that will run on the first boot of each cluster machine (install software, configure services, perform setup tasks, etc.).

### Summary
On the right-hand side, you can see a summary of your cluster with estimated costs prior to creating it. Use the hourly/monthly toggle to show estimated pricing for those lengths of time.

Once you are happy, click **Create cluster** and your cluster will be built and deployed.
