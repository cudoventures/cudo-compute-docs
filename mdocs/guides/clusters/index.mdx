A cluster is a group of dedicated bare metal machines that are designed to work together to provide high performance computing capabilities. CUDO Compute offers clusters with 8 GPUs per machine (and many machines per cluster) allowing you to run large-scale workloads without the overhead of virtualization.

## Features

- Dedicated hardware (groups of bare metal machines) with full control over the hardware
- High performance (up to 8 GPUs per machine) for AI inference, training, data analysis & scientific simulations
- Scalable: add or remove machines to match workload requirements
- Flexible configurations including Infiniband networking, high-speed storage, NFS volumes and more

## Pricing

Cluster prices are variable depending on your configuration. For more information see the [cluster pricing](https://www.cudocompute.com/pricing/clusters) page.
