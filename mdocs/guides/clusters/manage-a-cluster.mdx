Clicking a cluster ID from the clusters list shows the cluster details page.

Use the quick buttons at the top-right of the page to:

- Resize a cluster
- Delete a cluster

## Resize a cluster

From the clusters list choose **⋮ > Resize cluster** or from a cluster details page choose the **Resize** quick action.

### Machine count
Enter the new number of machines and click **Resize cluster**. Machines will be added or removed to reach the desired count.

<Note>
Resizing will remove arbitrary machines when reducing the count. To delete a specific machine instead, see Manage cluster machines.
</Note>

### SSH keys
Choose which SSH keys to deploy (all collaborator keys, only your keys, or custom keys).

### Start script
Update the start script that will run on first boot for any new machines.

## Delete a cluster

From the clusters list choose **⋮ > Delete cluster** or from the cluster details page use the **Delete** quick action. Confirm the deletion to permanently remove the cluster and its machines.
