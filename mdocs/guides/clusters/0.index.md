A cluster is a group of dedicated bare metal machines that are designed to work together to provide high performance computing capabilities. CUDO Compute offers clusters with 8 GPUs per machine, and many cluster machines, allowing users to run large-scale workloads without the overhead of virtualization.

## Features

- **Dedicated hardware**: Groups of bare metal cluster machines, full control over the hardware and configure it to your specific needs.
- **High performance**: With 8 GPUs per machine, Clusters are designed for high performance computing tasks, such as AI inference, machine learning, data analysis, and scientific simulations.
- **Scalability**: Clusters can be easily scaled up or down to meet your workload requirements, allowing you to optimize your resources and costs.
- **Flexible configurations**: You can choose from a range of hardware configurations, including Infiniband networking, high-speed storage, nfs volumes and more, to create a cluster that meets your specific needs.
