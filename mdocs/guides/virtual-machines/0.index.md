A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses a virtualised server environment. You can provision virtual machines on the CUDO Compute platform for a wide range of workloads. See our [range of tutorials](/docs/tutorials) for an idea of what you can do.

## Features

- Monitoring interface
- Deployment from private images
- Resizing
- Project based permissions
- Virtual Network Computing (VNC)

### Operating systems

Virtual machines boot disks can be loaded with either a private image or a public image. For more information about private images, see [private image documentation](/docs/images).

Below is an updated list of all available public images on the platform:
