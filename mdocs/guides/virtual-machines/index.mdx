A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses a virtualised server environment. Provision virtual machines for a wide range of workloads. See tutorials for ideas.

## Features

- Monitoring interface
- Deployment from private images
- Resizing
- Project based permissions
- Virtual Network Computing (VNC)

### Operating systems

Virtual machine boot disks can use either a private or public image. For private images see the [Create an image](/mdocs/guides/images/create-an-image) guide.

import { PublicImagesGrid } from '/snippets/PublicImagesGrid.jsx';

<PublicImagesGrid />


## Pricing

Virtual machine prices vary by configuration. See the [pricing page](https://www.cudocompute.com/pricing) for details.
