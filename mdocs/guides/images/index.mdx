Private images are boot disk snapshots (copies of an entire boot disk). Create private images from virtual machine boot disks & deploy new virtual machines from them.

## Public images

You can choose from a range of public images when deploying a virtual machine: standard operating systems (Windows, Ubuntu) and packaged Ubuntu images with preinstalled drivers.

import { PublicImagesGrid } from '/snippets/PublicImagesGrid.jsx';

<PublicImagesGrid />

## Pricing

Private image pricing varies per data center. See the pricing page (/pricing?view=virtual-resources) for more information.
