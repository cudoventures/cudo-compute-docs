Private images are boot disk images. These are copies of the entire contents of the disk and represent it exactly. On the CUDO Compute platform you can create private images from your virtual machine boot disks & deploy new virtual machines from these.

## Public images

There are a range of public images available to choose from when deploying a virtual machine. Ranging from standard operating system images such as Windows, to packaged Ubuntu images with preinstalled drivers.
