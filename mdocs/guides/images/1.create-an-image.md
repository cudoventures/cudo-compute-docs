::Alert
To create a private image, you first need a virtual machine. See [Create a virtual machine](/docs/virtual-machines/create-a-virtual-machine).
::

Navigate to the [virtual machine details page](/docs/virtual-machines/manage-a-virtual-machine) of the virtual machine you wish to create an image from. Here you will find a "Disks" table, click the action menu of the disk you wish to create an image from and select **"Create image from disk"**.

::Alert
Please note that private images are charged at the storage rate for the data center that your image will be stored in.
::

- **Image ID** - _this is the name of your image, it must be unique_
- **Description** - _this is a description of your image_

Once you are happy, click "Create image" and your private image created.

When your image has been created, you will see a confirmation message and be able to [Create a new virtual machine](/docs/virtual-machines/create-a-virtual-machine) using this disk image.
