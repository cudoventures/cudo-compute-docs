## Viewing all images

From the images page, you can see all of the private and public images available to you.

- For **private images** you'll be able to see the image ID, description, data center and size of the image.
- For **public images** you'll be able to see the image name, ID, and size of the image.

Public images are available at all data centers.

## Delete a private image

To delete a private image, click "Delete" on the private image that you want to delete.
