Navigate to the project you wish to create a security group inside. From inside the project you can select **"Security groups"** from the sidebar.

When you navigate to the security groups page, click **"Create security group"**. A slideover will open containing a form with the following fields to complete.

- **Security group ID** - this is the name of your security group, it must be unique
- **Data center** - this is the data center that your security group will be deployed to
- **Description** - this is an optional description of your security group

Once you are happy, click **"Create security group"** and your security group will be deployed to the data center you selected.

::Alert
This will create a security group with no rules applied. You will need to [add rules](/docs/security-groups/managing-security-group-rules) to your security group to allow traffic to your virtual machines.
