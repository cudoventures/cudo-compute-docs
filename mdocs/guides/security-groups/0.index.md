A security group is a set of firewall rules that control the traffic for your instances. After creating a security group in a data center, you can define both inbound and outbound rules. These security groups can be [configured](/docs/security-groups/managing-security-group-rules) to manage public traffic and also within the IP address ranges specified in your [private network](/docs/networks).
