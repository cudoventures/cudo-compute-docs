"Adding a user to a project","Help Question","2025-05-22","Ryan Ede","adding-a-user-to-a-project","Compute","**Adding a user to a project** 

As the project owner, you can add users to your project. These users can be team members collaborating on the project or individuals you want to grant visibility.

To add a user:

- Navigate to **Settings** in the left column of your account.
- In the **Permissions** section at the top of the Settings page, you can manage user access and add new users to the project.

![e030f70b-9784-429d-952f-2396797b7352](//images.ctfassets.net/8r8i0zgzl3nn/1EQshLN1Sakmsj3fLV20wU/10c04e7f0803286cef1a4b08fd42e4ea/e030f70b-9784-429d-952f-2396797b7352.webp)

**User Roles**

You can assign different user roles to the users in your project to control user permissions and define their level of access. Roles determine what actions users can perform and the visibility they have within the project.

In the **Permissions** section of the **Settings** page, click the **""Add User""** button to add a new user to your project.

![1fb43cae-126e-45a1-a0e1-fe22cca0039e](//images.ctfassets.net/8r8i0zgzl3nn/eArlW6ZYOmcrLSLZstu1i/5a747b1b5a235944e608e23118feafcc/1fb43cae-126e-45a1-a0e1-fe22cca0039e.webp)

You will now be prompted to select the “**Role**” you want to assign the user and provide the “**User Email**” address. 

**Note** The user must already be registered on the platform before being added.

The project owner can assign three different user roles to manage access and permissions:

1. **Owner**
    - Has full control over the project.
    - Can access project settings.
    - Can create, modify, and delete resources, including the project itself.
2. **Editor**
    - Can create and manage resources within the project.
    - Can delete virtual machines (VMs) created by others.
    - Cannot access project settings.
    - Cannot delete the project itself.
3. **Viewer**
    - Has read-only access to the project.
    - Cannot create or modify resources.
    - Cannot delete the project.
