## Get started in three steps

A step-by-step guide to run you through the steps required to get started on CUDO Compute.

### Step 1: Set up your account and generate an API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Sign up or log in">
    1. Create an account at [compute.cudo.org](https://compute.cudo.org) or log in if you already have one.
    2. Verify your email address.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Create an API key">
     Create an API key from your [dashboard](https://compute.cudo.org/profile/api-keys) and save it somewhere secure.

    <Tip>Your API key is like a password, keep it safe and don't share it with anyone.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Create a billing account and project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="Create a billing account">
    To start deploying resources you'll need to create a billing account. These steps are all included in the onboarding displayed in the console after registering.

    1. From the [dashboard](https://compute.cudo.org), navigate to the Billing section and create a new billing account.
    2. Add a payment method to your billing account.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="folder" title="Create a project">
    Next, you'll need a project to deploy resources into. You can create a new project from the [dashboard](https://compute.cudo.org/projects).

    <Tip>Projects use global IDs, so make sure to note yours!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Start deploying resources

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Deploy using the dashboard or API">
  You can deploy resources using the [web dashboard](https://compute.cudo.org) or programmatically using our [CLI tool](cli) or [REST API](api).

  <Tip>Check out our [API reference](api/introduction) for more details on how to use the API.</Tip>
