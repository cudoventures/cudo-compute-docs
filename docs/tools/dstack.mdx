## dstack on CUDO Compute

[dstack](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack) is an open-source alternative to Kubernetes and Slurm, built to streamline AI development and deployment across cloud providers. dstack provides the following capabilities:

- **Development environments**: Quickly set up remote machines with your code and IDE for interactive coding. Ideal for testing code in your IDE or notebook before task scheduling or deployment.

- **Tasks**: Schedule jobs or run web apps with configurable dependencies, resources, and more. Suited for training, fine-tuning, or app testing, with support for distributed clusters.

- **Services**: Deploy scalable web apps or models as private or public endpoints, complete with dependency management, resource allocation, and scaling rules.

- **Fleets**: Efficiently manage clusters and instances for cloud and on-prem resources, reusable across dev environments, tasks, and services.

dstack is available as a self-hosted open-source version and a hosted marketplace version.

## Install dstack

Create a config file for CUDO and save it to ``~/.dstack/server/config.yml``. You will need to have created a project and know its ID, and you will need to create an API key in the CUDO Compute console.

```yaml
projects:
  - name: main
    backends:
      - type: cudo
        project_id: my-cudo-project
        creds:
          type: api_key
          api_key: 7487240a466624b48de22865589
```

Install dstack and start the server

```shell
pip install "dstack[all]" -U
dstack server
```

## Try out a dstack deployment
Now you can create a project directory and initialize it for use with dstack:

```shell
mkdir quickstart && cd quickstart
dstack init
```

Create a yaml file ``.dstack.yaml`` inside your project directory to define your dstack deployment, here we are deploying a remote IDE (vscode):

```yaml
type: dev-environment
# The name is optional, if not specified, generated randomly
name: vscode

python: '3.11'
# Uncomment to use a custom Docker image
# image: dstackai/base:py3.13-0.6-cuda-12.1

ide: vscode

# Use either spot or on-demand instances
spot_policy: auto

# Uncomment to request resources
# resources:
#  gpu: 24GB
```

Now apply the dstack configuration:
```shell
dstack apply -f .dstack.yml
```
