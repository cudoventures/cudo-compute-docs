A volume is an NFS (Network File System) that can be accessed from cluster machines. Use volumes to store data that persists beyond the lifetime of a cluster machine (datasets, models, logs, databases, user data, etc.).

## Features

- NFS accessible from cluster machines
- Large capacity persistent storage
- Attach / detach independently of cluster lifecycle

## Pricing

Volume pricing is data center dependent. You will need to configure a cluster and volume on the CUDO Compute platform to see the current volume price.
