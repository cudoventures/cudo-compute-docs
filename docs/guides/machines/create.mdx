Navigate to the project you wish to create a bare metal machine in. Then, navigate to "bare metal machines" from the side navigation and click 'Create machine' or [follow this link](https://compute.cudo.org/?create=bare-metal).

## Configuration

### Name
Enter a name for your bare metal machine. This will be used to identify your bare metal machine in the bare metal machines list.

<Note>
Your bare metal machine name must be 1 to 30 characters in length, can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, must start with a letter, cannot end with a hyphen and cannot be in use.
</Note>

### Data center
By default, your bare metal machine will be deployed to the cheapest data center available depending on your configuration. If you have a specific data center you would like to deploy to, you can select it from the "Data center" options.

### Machine type

Here you can configure the machine type you would like to deploy. The specifications of the machines will be shown as a list, selecting one will show you the specifications in the summary on the right-hand side.

### Operating system

You can select the operating system you would like to deploy on your bare metal machine. The options available will depend on the machine type you have selected. The following options are available:

- Ubuntu 22.04 (ubuntu/jammy)
- Ubuntu 24.04 (ubuntu/noble)

### SSH keys
You can configure the SSH keys you would like to be deployed to your bare metal machine. You can choose from the following options:

- **Include all project collaborator keys** - This will include the keys of all the users that you have given access to your project
- **Include only my keys** - This will include just the keys you have added
- **Use custom keys** - This will allow you to add any keys you wish for this bare metal machine

### Cloud-init configuration
You can configure the cloud-init configuration you would like to be deployed to your bare metal machine. This will allow you to configure your machine on first boot. The cloud init configuration will include the SSH keys from the SSH keys section above and you can also add your own configuration.

For example, you can add the following configuration to set the hostname of your machine:

```yaml
# cloud-config
hostname: my-machine
```
This will set the hostname of your machine to "my-machine" on first boot.

You can also add other configuration options, such as setting up users, installing packages, and configuring network settings. For more information on cloud-init configuration, you can refer to the [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Commitments
Most bare metal machines will require a commitment. You can configure the commitment you would like to make for your bare metal machine. The options available will depend on the machine type you have selected. The following options are available:

- **No commitment** - This will allow you to use the bare metal machine on an hourly basis, most bare metal machines will not offer this option.
- **1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 month commitment** - This will allow you to use the bare metal machine on a monthly basis for the specified number of months. The longer the commitment, the cheaper the price will be.

### Summary
On the right-hand side, you can see a summary of your bare metal machine, with estimated costs prior to creating it. You can also use the hourly/monthly toggle to show estimated pricing for those lengths of time.

Once you are happy, click **"Create bare metal machine"** and your bare metal machine will be built and deployed.
