Your billing account can be manually deleted only if there are __no pending invoices__.

To delete your billing account, please follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Billing Account page.
- If you have multiple accounts, select the desired billing account.
- On the specific billing account page, go to the Settings menu.
- Click the red Delete Billing Account button.
- Enter your billing account name when prompted, and then confirm by clicking Delete Billing Account.

__Important:__ If you have outstanding invoices, please settle them first. Once the payment is processed, wait approximately 30 minutes for the system to update, and then attempt to delete the account again.

If you are still experiencing issues deleting your billing account, feel free to contact our support team via the chat bubble located in the bottom corner of the page.

Be sure to include the details of your issue in your initial message for faster assistance.
