<Warning>
Once you delete a VM, this cannot be recovered. If you wish to delete your VM, please first make sure your data is backed up.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to the project
2. Navigate to the Virtual machines page and identify the virtual machine you wish to delete.
3. Click on the vertical 3 dots menu on the right side.
4. Choose the option "Delete virtual machine" and confirm the deletion by clicking the Delete virtual machine button.

It is important to delete the virtual machine once you don't need it any more to avoid accruing additional costs. Choosing to stop the virtual machine means the resources are still reserved for the virtual machine.
