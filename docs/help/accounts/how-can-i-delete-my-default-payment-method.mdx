Once fully set up, a billing account requires a default payment method. This cannot be removed before a new payment method is added and set as the new default.

If you wish to delete this:
add a new payment method, set it as a default, then delete the old entry;

The system cannot choose a new payment method automatically, so it is important a default payment method is set before removing any payment methods recorded.
