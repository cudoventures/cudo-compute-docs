You can change your password from the [Security page](https://compute.cudo.org/profile/security) in the console. Click Change password, enter your new password in the Password box and click Change password.
Next time you log in, you will need to use the new password.

If you need to change the password for any of the other social providers such as Google or GitHub, please check the available support documentations for the respective social provider.

If you forgot your password, please see [this guide](/docs/help/accounts/i-forgot-my-password-what-can-i-do).
